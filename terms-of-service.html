    <p>Last updated: 24 October 2024</p>

    <section>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Parent101 app,
        operated by Blank Canvas Designs Private Limited. By using the app, you
        agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms,
        please do not use the app.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. General Use</h2>
      <p>
        Parent101 is designed to provide parenting advice and tools, including a
        chat feature powered by AI. The app is for personal use only and should
        not be used for commercial purposes or distributed to third parties
        without prior permission from Blank Canvas Designs Private Limited.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Safety Limitation</h2>
      <p>
        Parent101 provides guidance based on information from child psychology
        but does not offer medical or therapeutic advice. The AI responses in
        the app should be considered general suggestions and are not a
        substitute for consulting a licensed child psychologist or other medical
        professionals. For any concerns regarding your child’s health or
        behavior, always seek advice from a professional.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. User Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for all activity conducted through your use of the
        app. You agree to use Parent101 only for lawful purposes and in a manner
        that does not infringe on the rights of others or restrict their use and
        enjoyment of the app. You must not attempt to reverse-engineer,
        decompile, or misuse the app in any way. You are responsible for your
        use of the app and any reliance on the AI-driven responses provided. If
        you or someone you know is experiencing mental health distress, contact
        a licensed mental health provider or emergency services. Parent101 is
        not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide adequate support for
        users experiencing serious mental health challenges.

      <h2>4. Data and Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        We do not store or transmit any personal data to external servers. All
        data remains on your device. However, for the AI-driven chat feature,
        certain inputs (e.g., text queries) are processed by OpenAI to generate
        responses. OpenAI does not retain or store this data after processing.
        Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more information on how data is
        handled.

        purpose of generating AI-driven responses. By using the app, you agree
        to OpenAI’s Terms of Service, and you are encouraged to review their
        terms:

        activities. In such cases, we are not responsible for any loss or damage
        arising from the termination of your access.
