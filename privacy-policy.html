    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 24 October 2024</p>

    <section>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how "Parent101" by Blank Canvas Designs
        Private Limited handles and protects your personal data. By using the
        app, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described below.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. General Information</h2>
      <p>
        "Parent101" is an iOS application designed to provide parenting advice
        and tools, including a chat feature with AI-driven responses informed by
        child psychology. However, the app is not a substitute for professional
        medical advice. We do not store any personal data on external servers;
        all data remains on your device.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Data Collection and Transmission</h2>
      <p>
        Parent101 operates locally on your device, meaning no personal data,
        chat history, or user inputs are stored externally. However, for the
        AI-driven chat feature, input data (e.g., text from your queries) is
        transmitted to OpenAI’s servers to generate responses. This data is
        processed solely for the purpose of providing parenting-related advice
        and is not stored by Blank Canvas Designs Private Limited or OpenAI.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We do not retain any of your personal data. All data generated within
        the app remains stored on your device. If you delete the app, all
        associated data will be permanently deleted from your device. Data
        transmitted to OpenAI is processed in real-time to generate responses
        and is not retained for future use.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. User Control and Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        You maintain full control over the data stored on your device. Deleting
        the app from your iPhone will permanently delete all associated data.
        Since no data is stored externally, removing the app deletes all your
        data.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Third-Party Data Processing (OpenAI)</h2>
      <p>
        The AI chat feature in Parent101 is powered by OpenAI’s services. Data
        provided to OpenAI is processed only to generate AI responses to your
        input and is not stored or reused. We encourage you to review OpenAI’s
        privacy policy for more information on their data practices.

    <section>
      <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our app is designed for use by parents and caregivers, and is not
        intended for use by children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly
        collect or store any data from individuals under 13. If we become aware
        that such data has been inadvertently provided, it will be promptly
        deleted.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Disclaimer on Medical Advice</h2>
      <p>
        While Parent101 is built with input from child psychologists, it is not
        intended as a source of medical advice. The information provided by the
        AI chat is for guidance purposes only and should not be considered a
        substitute for consulting a licensed child psychologist or medical
        professional. Always seek professional medical advice for any concerns
        regarding your child’s well-being.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We follow best practices for security within the iOS environment. We
        recommend users take standard precautions, such as using strong
        passwords and enabling device security features, to protect their
        personal data on the device.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You will be notified
        of any significant changes through an update in the app. The latest
        version of the Privacy Policy will always be available within the app
        and on our website.
